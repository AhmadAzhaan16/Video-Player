This project implements a video player application that allows users to preview and play videos from a selection of thumbnails. The HTML file provides the structure with video thumbnails and a video player section. The JavaScript file manages the functionality, including toggling play/pause, stopping the video, skipping forward/backward, and adjusting the volume. Clicking a thumbnail loads and plays the corresponding video. The CSS file styles the layout and controls, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing interface. The code dynamically updates the video source based on user interaction and provides real-time control over video playback.
